# diy-lisp

This is a simple port of the LISP implemented in [kvalle's awesome diy-lisp workshop](https://github.com/kvalle/diy-lisp). If this sounds interesting you should probably go over there and read, as this readme will not contain any useful information.

The original workshop implements a LISP in Python, and this is a port to Javascript to make it run in the browser. As of now it only runs on Node.js, but that will change.

## Run it

	node repl.js

(Although the intention was to create an actual REPL, I found out that I was too lazy to implement just that)

[Assert](https://www.npmjs.org/package/assert) is required to run the tests, so be sure to `npm install` before running them.
